### Checklist before creating a Pull Request

Submit only relevant commits. We don't mind many commits in a pull request, but they must be
relevant as explained below.

- **Use a feature branch** The pull request should be created from a feature branch, and not from
  _develop_. See below for why.
- **No merge-commits** If you have commits that looks like this _"Merge branch 'my-branch' into
  develop"_ or _"Merge branch 'develop' of <https://github.com/jmuelbert/anniversaryreminder> into
  develop"_ you're probably using merge instead of
  [rebase](https://help.github.com/articles/about-git-rebase) locally. See below on _Handling
  updates from upstream_.
- **Squash commits** Often we create temporary commits like _"Started implementing feature x"_ and
  then _"Did a bit more on feature x"_. Squash these commits together using
  [interactive rebase](https://help.github.com/articles/about-git-rebase). Also see
  [Squashing commits with rebase](https://gitready.com/advanced/2009/02/10/squashing-commits-with-rebase.html).
- **Descriptive commit messages** If a commit's message isn't descriptive, change it using
  [interactive rebase](https://help.github.com/articles/about-git-rebase). Refer to issues using
  `#issue`. Example of a bad message ~~"Small cleanup"~~. Example of good message: _"Removed
  Security.Claims header from FSM, which broke Mono build per #62"_. Don't be afraid to write long
  messages, if needed. Try to explain _why_ you've done the changes. The Erlang repo has some info
  on
  [writing good commit messages](https://github.com/erlang/otp/wiki/Writing-good-commit-messages).
- **No one-commit-to-rule-them-all** Large commits that changes too many things at the same time are
  very hard to review. Split large commits into smaller. See this
  [StackOverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6217156/break-a-previous-commit-into-multiple-commits)
  for information on how to do this.
- **Tests** Add relevant tests and make sure all existing ones still passes. Tests can be run using
  the command
- **No Warnings** Make sure your code do not produce any build warnings.

After reviewing a Pull request, we might ask you to fix some commits. After you've done that you
need to force push to update your branch in your local fork.

#### Title and Description for the Pull Request

Give the PR a descriptive title and in the description field describe what you have done in general
terms and why. This will help the reviewers greatly, and provide a history for the future.

Especially if you modify something existing, be very clear! Have you changed any algorithms, or did
you just intend to reorder the code? Justify why the changes are needed.

### Getting started

Make sure you have a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account.

- Fork, clone, add upstream to the dotNetty repository. See
  [Fork a repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) for more detailed instructions or
  follow the instructions below.

- Fork by clicking _Fork_ on <https://github.com/jmuelbert/anniversaryreminder>
- Clone your fork locally.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/anniversaryreminder
```

- Add an upstream remote.

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/jmuelbert/anniversaryreminder
```

You now have two remotes: _upstream_ points to <https://github.com/jmuelbert/anniversaryreminder>,
and _origin_ points to your fork on GitHub.

- Make changes. See below.

Unsure where to start? Issues marked with
[_up for grabs_](https://github.com/jmuelbert/anniversaryreminder/labels/up%20for%20grabs) are
things we want help with.

### Making changes

**Never** work directly on _dev_ or _master_ and you should never send a pull request from master -
always from a feature branch created by you.

- Pick an [issue](https://github.com/jmuelbert/anniversaryreminder/issues). If no issue exists
  (search first) create one.
- Get any changes from _upstream_.

```bash
git checkout dev
git fetch upstream
git merge --ff-only upstream/dev
git push origin dev     #(optional) this makes sure dev in your own fork on GitHub is up to date
```

See <https://help.github.com/articles/fetching-a-remote> for more info

- Create a new feature branch. It's important that you do your work on your own branch and that it's
  created off of _dev_. Tip: Give it a descriptive name and include the issue number, e.g.
  `implement-lengthframeencoder-323` or `295-implement-recvbuffer`, so that others can see what is
  being worked on.

```bash
git checkout -b my-new-branch-123
```

- Work on your feature. Commit.
- Rebase often, see below.
- Make sure you adhere to _Checklist before creating a Pull Request_ described above.
- Push the branch to your fork on GitHub

```bash
git push origin my-new-branch-123
```

- Send a Pull Request, see <https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests> to the _develop_
  branch.

See also: [Understanding the GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) (we're using
`develop` as our master branch)

### Handling updates from upstream

While you're working away in your branch it's quite possible that your upstream _dev_ may be
updated. If this happens you should:

- [Stash](https://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Tools-Stashing) any un-committed changes you need to

```bash
git stash
```

- Update your local _dev_ by fetching from _upstream_

```bash
git checkout dev
git fetch upstream
git merge --ff-only upstream/dev
```

- Rebase your feature branch on _dev_. See
  [Git Branching - Rebasing](https://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Branching-Rebasing) for more info on
  rebasing

```bash
git checkout my-new-branch-123
git rebase dev
git push origin dev     #(optional) this makes sure dev in your own fork on GitHub is up to date
```

This ensures that your history is "clean" i.e. you have one branch off from _dev_ followed by your
changes in a straight line. Failing to do this ends up with several "messy" merges in your history,
which we don't want. This is the reason why you should always work in a branch and you should never
be working in, or sending pull requests from _dev_.

If you're working on a long running feature then you may want to do this quite often, rather than
run the risk of potential merge issues further down the line.

### Making changes to a Pull request

If you realize you've missed something after submitting a Pull request, just commit to your local
branch and push the branch just like you did the first time. This commit will automatically be
included in the Pull request. If we ask you to change already published commits using interactive
rebase (like squashing or splitting commits or rewriting commit messages) you need to force push
using `-f`:

```bash
git push -f origin my-new-branch-123
```

### All my commits are on develop. How do I get them to a new branch?

If all commits are on _develop_ you need to move them to a new feature branch.

You can rebase your local _develop_ on _upstream/develop_ (to remove any merge commits), rename it,
and recreate _develop_

```bash
git checkout develop
git rebase upstream/develop
git branch -m my-new-branch-123
git branch develop upstream/develop
```

Or you can create a new branch off of _develop_ and then cherry pick the commits

```bash
git checkout -b my-new-branch-123 upstream/develop
git cherry-pick rev                   #rev is the revisions you want to pick
git cherry-pick rev                   #repeat until you have picked all commits
git branch -m develop old-develop     #rename dev
git branch develop upstream/develop   #create a new dev
```
